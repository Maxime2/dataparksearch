This directory contains a test suite for DataparkSearch Engine.
To run it, please

1. Compile DataparkSearch with any SQL database support.

2. Set DPS_TEST_DBADDR environment variable specifying the database
   you want to run tests with, in format the same with DBAddr
   indexer.conf command.

   For example,

      export DPS_TEST_DBADDR=mysql://root@localhost/test/


   or

      export DPS_TEST_DBADDR=sqlite://localhost/home/bar/sqlite.db/


   You don't need to create tables, test program will do it itself.

   NOTE: all existing data will be lost in this database
   after running the tests.


3. Run "make check"
