INSTALLATION

1. Install DataparkSearch at your system. You need enable threadsless 
version of libdpsearch (use --enable-threadsless option for confirure).


2. Follow the standard installation procedure for Perl modules, which is to
type the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

You'll probably need to do the last as root.
