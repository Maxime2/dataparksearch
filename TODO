 General development directions

* More various transport protocols support.
* More various APIs. e.g write Java class with libdpsearch support.
* Support for huge databases with hundred or thousand millions documents.
* Make it more managable, i.e. administration tools, etc.


Search quality and results presentation
---------------------------------------
* Click rank
* Administator defined dynamic site priority:
	- approved sites which should be displayed in the top of results;
	- disapproved sites (e.g. for abuse) which should not be displayed.
* Take in account words context: <b>, <font size="xx">, <big> and so on.
* Optional automatic URL limit by SERVER_NAME variable.
* "Exclude" limits, for example "to search though everything except
  given site": ue=http://esite/
* Rank URLs with long pathnames lower than direct hits on let's say a domain
name with no directory path.


Indexing related stuff
----------------------
* Detect clones on site level. Currently it is implemented on page level
only. The idea is to detect that site being indexed is a mirror of another
site without having to index all pages but after indexing several pages only.
* SPAM clearance.
* Fix that indexer bacame slow when ServerTable is big. This is because
of full consecutive examination. Make in-memory cache for ServerTable part.
* Fix that "posgreSQL.org" and "posgresql.org" are considered as a
different sites.
* FTP digest ls-lR.gz support. For example,ftp://ftp.chg.ru/ls-lR.gz
* Make it possible for external parsers to return converted content
together with headers like Content-Type, Title and so on.


Charset related stuff
---------------------
* Remove "ForceIISCharset1251 yes/no"command. Replcase it with
enhanced "CharsetByServer <charset> <regexp> [<regexp>...]"
commmand.
* Stateful character sets support: UTF-7, Asian ISO-2022-XX
and others. They will not be used as a LocalCharset because
of much space, however indexer should be able to index them,
as well as search frontend should be able to use them as
a BrowserCharset.


Misc
----
* Smart search results cache cleaning after reindexing.
* Make it possible to set table names in indexer.conf and search.htm
* Learn about dublin core. A simple set of standard metadata for web pages.
  http://www.searchtools.com/related/metadata.html#dc
* Add curl library support.
* Optimization for clusterisation.


Portability and code quality
----------------------------
Remove warnings on various platforms. Currenly it is built without
warnings on Linux and FreeBSD with these CFLAGS:

-Wall
-Wconversion
-Wshadow
-Wpointer-arith
-Wcast-qual
-Wcast-align
-Wwrite-strings
-Waggregate-return
-Wstrict-prototypes
-Wmissing-prototypes
-Wmissing-declarations
-Wredundant-decls
-Wnested-externs
-Wlong-long
-Winline

However some other platform compilers do produce warnings.
For example, mixed signed/unsigned chars on NetBSD Alpha compiler.
Please report those warnings and suggetions to fix to maxime@sochi.net.ru
