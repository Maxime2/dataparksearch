	<para>Search results cache allows <filename>search.cgi</filename> to make very fast
response on recently used queries as well as user's navigation though the pages of the same result.</para>

	<para>Search results cache is disabled by default. You may use
<command>Cache yes</command> command in <filename>search.htm</filename> to enable results
caching. If you use <literal>searchd</literal>, add "<command>Cache yes</command>"
command to <filename>searchd.conf</filename> file.</para>

	<para>Search cache is located in
<literal>$PREFIX/var/cache/</literal> subdirectory, where
<literal>$PREFIX</literal> is <application>DataparkSearch</application> installation base
directory. Each result is stored in a separate file.</para>

<para><indexterm><primary>Command</primary><secondary>HoldCache</secondary></indexterm>
By defaults, search results cache is not deleted
automatically. You have to delete it every time after indexer's work
to avoid displaying non-recent cached results.
Or you may specify a refresh period for search results cache using
<command>HoldCache</command> command:
<programlisting>
HoldCache &lt;time&gt;
</programlisting>
For &lt;time&gt; format see description of <command>Period</command> command in <xref linkend="period_cmd"/>.
<programlisting>
HoldCache 3h
</programlisting>
<!--
It is also reasonable
to insert cache cleaning into system crontab, for example once a
day. To clean cache just remove all files in
<literal>$PREFIX/var/cache/</literal> directory. For example:
		<programlisting>
/bin/rm -f /usr/local/dpsearch/var/cache/*
</programlisting>
-->
