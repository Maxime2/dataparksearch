In order to produce documentation from XML source,
these packages need to be installed:

openjade
dsssl-docbook-modular
docbook-4.1
docbook-tdg
docbook-xml-4.1.2

Optionaly it may happen you need to add this line:
CATALOG "dsssl/modular/catalog"
into file /usr/local/share/sgml/docbook/catalog.


---------------
#!/bin/sh
openjade -v -t sgml -wno-valid \
         -d ./mnogo.dsl \
         /usr/local/share/sgml/docbook/dsssl/modular/dtds/decls/xml.dcl \
         book.xml
